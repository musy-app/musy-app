# Design Principles

- **Simplicity** -

- **Accessibility** -

- **Themes** - Making your themes are easy and fun. If you start building your own theme, the only thing you have to remember is that Kitchen has been thought in dark first. So, `dark` is dark when you are in dark mode and light when you are in light mode. And `light` is the opposite. Remember that accent colors are static and never change from dark to light mode. Anyway you can create your own themes easly throught our [Theme Builder](theme-builder).
